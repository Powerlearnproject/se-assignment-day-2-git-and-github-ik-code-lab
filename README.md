## Explain the fundamental concepts of version control and why GitHub is a popular tool for managing versions of code. How does version control help in maintaining project integrity?

ANS:
Version control is a system that records changes to a file. 
The fundamental concepts of version control
a.	Repository
b.	Commit
c.	Version history
d.	Branching
e.	Merging
Github is popular because
a.	Large community size which will enable developers solve problems they encounter since someone in the community has solved similar problem.
b.	Ease of use as it is a user-friendly interface
c.	Social coding where developers can share, contribute and learn from others projects.
Version control helps maintain integrity by tracking changes made in the project files, allows developers to revert to previous version of the project and allows multiple developers work on the same project simultaneously without overwriting each other changes.


## Describe the process of setting up a new repository on GitHub. What are the key steps involved, and what are some of the important decisions you need to make during this process?

ANS: Process in setting a repository.
a.	Create a github account
b.	Select new repository
c.	Fill in repository name and description
d.	Select either Public or Private
e.	Then select “create repository”
Key steps and important decision to be made.
A short and easy to remember repository name
A good description to help understand the purpose of the project
A good README file is important as it will explain the project, how to use it and how to contribute.
Pubic or Private is crucial. It determines whether you want the project to be share to the world or kept private.
.gitigmore templates is essential to avoid committing unnecessary files to your repository.


## Discuss the importance of the README file in a GitHub repository. What should be included in a well-written README, and how does it contribute to effective collaboration?

ANS: A good README file is important as it will explain the project, how to use it and how to contribute.
Things to be included:
a.	Project title
b.	Description
c.	Installations instruction
d.	Contribution guidelines
e.	License information
How it contributes to effective collaboration
a.	Facilitates communication
b.	Promotes consistency
c.	Reduces friction

## Compare and contrast the differences between a public repository and a private repository on GitHub. What are the advantages and disadvantages of each, particularly in the context of collaborative projects?

ANS: Pubic or Private is crucial. It determines whether you want the project to be share to the world or kept private.
Advantages of public repository
a.	Anyone on the internet can view code, clone or fork repository. Its open to contribution from the global community and its generally free for both individuals and organization
Disadvantages of public repository
a.	Must be careful not to commit sensitive date. Code can be copied or used without proper attribution.
Advantages of private repository
a.	Necessary for closed source development, maintain control over who can access and modify code. Safeguard code and confidential data
Disadvantages of private repository
a.	Miss out on potential contributions from the community. Projects are less discoverable and private repository requires a paid plan.
In context of collaboration, public or private repository depends on the project and sensitivity of the data. Open-source projects with foster community involvement requires the repository to be public. Learning projects should use public repository. Private repositories are used when data are sensitive and has API keys and are required for internal projects where confidentiality and controlled access are essential.


## Detail the steps involved in making your first commit to a GitHub repository. What are commits, and how do they help in tracking changes and managing different versions of your project?

ANS:On Gitbash
1.	Git config –global user.name “your username”
2.	Git config –global user.email ‘’your email’’
3.	Git init
4.	Git add .
5.	Git commit-m “first commit”
6.	Git branch -m main
7.	Git push -u origin main ”repo link”
Commits are like snapshot of the project at a point in time and it records any changes made after the last commit.
They create a chronological history of the project which allows every change made to be seen. Files modified, added and deleted can be seen and reverting to previous version can be done by going to the specific commit.


## How does branching work in Git, and why is it an important feature for collaborative development on GitHub? Discuss the process of creating, using, and merging branches in a typical workflow.

ANS: Branching allows developers to create a parallel version of their code. These multiple independent timelines allow collaborative development.
Why branching is important for collaborative development in github.
a.	Parallel development
b.	Bug fixed
c.	Experimentation with a new idea can be done without affecting the main code
d.	Code reviews
Process of creating, using and merging branches
1.	Git branch new branch (creates a branch named new branch but doesn’t switch to it)
2.	Git checkout -b new branch (to create the branch and switch to it)
3.	Git checkout new branch (in the new branch, changes can be made with commit
Merging branches
1.	Git checkout main
2.	Git merge new branch
If there is no conflict then it will be merge but if there is a conflict, git will mark the conflicting files. There is need to manually resolve the conflicts, stage the changes and commit the merge.
Typical workflow is:
Create branch. Develop. Commit. Push. Create a push request.  Review. Merge. Delete the branch


## Explore the role of pull requests in the GitHub workflow. How do they facilitate code review and collaboration, and what are the typical steps involved in creating and merging a pull request?

ANS: Role for pull request
Code review. Collaboration. Version control. Quality assurance. Knowledge sharing. Controlled merging.
Typical steps involved in creating and merging a pull request.
Create a feature branch. Make changes and commit. Push the branch to github. Create a pull request. Code review. Resolve conflicts if any. Approve the pull request. Merge the pull request. Delete the feature branch.


## Discuss the concept of "forking" a repository on GitHub. How does forking differ from cloning, and what are some scenarios where forking would be particularly useful?

ANS: Forking allows someone to create a personal copy of someone else repository. The copy is independent of the original repository allowing the person to make changes without affecting the original project.
Difference between cloning and forking is that cloning creates a local copy of the repository on your computer while forking creates a remote copy of a repository on your github account. Cloning is for local development while forking allows contribution to other people projects.
Forking is useful for contributing to open-source project, experimenting with existing code without changing the original project.
Learning is also possible as its a good avenue to learning. It also allows bug fixing.

## Examine the importance of issues and project boards on GitHub. How can they be used to track bugs, manage tasks, and improve project organization? Provide examples of how these tools can enhance collaborative efforts.

ANS: Issues and project boards are tools used to improve project which are used for bugs tracking, task management and project organization.
Track bugs:  when a bug is detected, an issue is created with a description of the problem, prioritized and based on the prioritization, teams members determine how serious the issue is and discuss solution 
Manage tasks: issues are broken down to little chunks, assign to team members and monitor progress.
Project organization:  a board is created with columns like “what to do” “working in progress” “concluded”. This help teams to know situation of the issue.


## Reflect on common challenges and best practices associated with using GitHub for version control. What are some common pitfalls new users might encounter, and what strategies can be employed to overcome them and ensure smooth collaboration?

ANS: challenges associated with github for version control is using the wrong terminology. This happens to new users. For terminology, learn all the terminology. For merging conflicts, use git conflict resolution tools and break down large merge to smaller merge. For .gitignore , make sure it is configured properly. Use. gitignore templates to review files. For commit messages, write a clear commit message. Adopt a commit message that indicates the type of change.
